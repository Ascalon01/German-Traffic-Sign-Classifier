## German Traffic Sign Recognition 

Project Overview
---
The goal of this project is to build a classifier to recognize taffic signs using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, We will then try out our model on images of German traffic signs that we find on the web.

Files in the repository
---
* Code for the algorithm is contained in the [IPython notebook](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) as well as python script [Python Script File](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.py)

* A [writeup](./writeup.md) detailing the results of the project and describing the procedure for classifying Traffic signs.

Running the code
---
This project was developed using Python 3.5. The IPython notebook can be run using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The project depends on the,
  1. [NumPY](http://www.numpy.org/)
  2. [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
  3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  4. [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
  5. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
